        <h2>Planet Earth</h2>
        <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by
            living things.

            While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system
            with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
            planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

            The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and
            Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>

        <h2>Jungles</h2>
        <p>On 3% of the Earth's surface, the rain forest is the habitat for half our animal species, even 80% of
            insects. So its wildlife is most competitive, like the birds of paradise's mating, and specialized with
            unique relationships of predation, parasitism etc. For plants, the quest for light is key to stratification,
            paralleled by interacting animals eating fruits, leaves and other animals. Even the jungle cacophony is
            stratified. On the soil, recycling specialist like fungi restart the cycle of life. In Central Africa even
            herds of elephants specialize in following self-made forest paths.</p>

        <h2>Ice Worlds</h2>
        <p>The polar caps have the most extreme seasonal contrasts, growing and melting vast ice masses, so wildlife
            adapts by annual migrations. The majority of Antartica is a vast barren permafrost. Only 3% of the coast and
            peninsular peaks are where life migrates to in the spring, for a short fertile summer, attracted by rich
            supplies of krill and fish. Only the Emperor penguin males breed 4 months in winter 100 miles inland. The
            Arctic has a more complete fauna which migrates back North from the continent. Here, the Polar bear is
            threatened because global warming defrosts its seal hunt platform ice too fast.</p>

        <h2>Ocean Deep</h2>
        <p>Open ocean, a vast biotope covering two thirds of the planet, some shallow, some as deep as the mountain
            ranges are high. The ocean has an immense, precariously complex food chain, varying from microscopic
            animals, like krill, to whales, which ironically feed mainly on the former. Most species swim or float in
            it, many coming up for air, while other dive in from land or air, often to feed, but also to procreate on
            the coast, where some species come to lay their eggs. Even the shore is covered with life, largely based on
            organic matter, such as corpses.</p>

        <h2>Deserts</h2>
        <p>A large and growing part of earth's land mass is covered in desert - each one widely varied in composition
            and dryness. Wildlife species have adapted in different ways to these different arid lands especially to get
            and conserve water. Some are physically desert-models, like camels, others just changed their diet and
            behavior. Most live mainly at night, when it's cooler. The largest desert is northern Africa's Sahara, US
            size and extremely sandy, the result of grinding erosion of mountains. Short moist moments or periods are
            taken intense advantage off, leading to such extravaganzas as the locust swarm./p>
